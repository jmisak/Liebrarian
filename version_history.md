## Version History: Digital Librarian Python Script

This document details the key changes and fixes made to the `app.py` script for the Digital Librarian application. Each version represents a significant update to improve robustness, functionality, and performance.

***

### Version 1: Initial Code Analysis (2025-06-29)
The original code was an HTML file with a basic structure for a digital librarian but lacked all the core backend functionality. The AI Assistant button and file ingestion were not working, and the dashboard was unstyled.

* **Changes Made:** No changes were made to the Python script in this version. The conversation focused on the HTML/JavaScript code.

***

### Version 2: RAG Pipeline Design (2025-09-18)
The initial Python-based RAG architecture was designed. This version laid the groundwork for a modular, enterprise-level application using Python libraries like `pandas`, `docx`, `pptx`, `chromadb`, and `gradio`.

* **Changes Made:** A complete `app.py` file was provided, structured with separate classes for `FileParser`, `VectorStoreManager`, `LLMClient`, and `DigitalLibrarian`. The script was configured to use `config.yaml` for settings and to connect to a local LM Studio server.

### Version 3: Indentation and Method Mismatch Fixes (2025-09-18)
Multiple errors were identified and fixed. The main issues were Python `IndentationError` and `TypeError` caused by incorrect code formatting and mismatched function arguments.

* **Changes Made:**
    * **Indentation Fixes:** Corrected inconsistent indentation throughout the `DigitalLibrarian` class, particularly in the `index_source_documents` and `answer_query` methods. This resolved `IndentationError` exceptions.
    * **Method Signature Fixes:** The `__init__` method of the `DigitalLibrarian` class was updated to correctly accept the `config` argument. The `answer_query` method's signature was corrected to accept all the arguments from the Gradio UI. This fixed `TypeError` exceptions.

### Version 4: Ingestion and Retrieval Failures (2025-09-18)
The application was failing to ingest documents and was returning a canned "no information found" response. This indicated a fundamental problem with the RAG retrieval process.

* **Changes Made:**
    * **Ingestion Fix:** A conditional check was added to the main execution block to ensure `index_source_documents()` is called only if the vector store is empty. This ensured files were ingested at startup.
    * **Batching Fix:** The `index_source_documents` method was modified to process documents in batches of `5000`. This prevented a `ValueError` caused by adding too many documents to ChromaDB at once.
    * **Retrieval Fix:** The `answer_query` method's logic was corrected to ensure that the LLM is only called if the vector database successfully retrieves relevant context. The previous issue was that the `context` variable was incorrectly evaluating to `False`, skipping the LLM call.

***

### Version 5: File Name and LLM Prompting (2025-09-19)
The user wanted the LLM to include file names in its response and wanted to make the vector search more robust.

* **Changes Made:**
    * **Filename Ingestion:** The `index_source_documents` method was updated to prepend the filename to each document chunk before it is embedded (`f"Source: {filename}\n\n{chunk}"`).
    * **UI Enhancements:** The `create_gradio_interface` function was updated to include a **keyword search checkbox**, a **file type dropdown**, and a **k-value slider**.
    * **LLM Prompt:** The `LLMClient.get_response` method was updated with a new `system_prompt` to explicitly instruct the LLM to cite the source filename first.

***

### Version 6: Final Code Integration (2025-09-19)
The final version integrated all the new features, including the UI changes, file-type filtering, keyword search, and the new system prompt.

* **Changes Made:**
    * **UI Integration:** The `submit_button.click` function in Gradio was updated to pass the new UI inputs (`query_input`, `search_type_checkbox`, `file_type_dropdown`, `k_value_slider`) to the `answer_query` method.
    * **Search Logic:** The `answer_query` method was updated with a conditional `if/else` block to switch between semantic search (RAG) and keyword search based on the `use_keyword_search` flag. A new `_search_by_keyword` method was added to handle the non-AI search.
    * **VectorStore Filtering:** The `VectorStoreManager.query` method was updated to accept a `file_type` argument and use ChromaDB's `where` clause to filter the search results.

This version history represents a complete evolution of the codebase from an initial design to a fully functional and robust RAG application.
